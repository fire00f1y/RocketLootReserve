# Rocket Loot Reserve

This is a fork of the [LootReserve](https://github.com/Anonomit/LootReserve) addon for World of Warcraft. We are using
it as a base and adding additional functionality in that our guild specifically needs. For a look into what is different, please see the [Design Document](/design/README.md)

## Installation

There are currently no plans to distribute this via one of the popular methods such as Curse or WowUp. Instead, you will need to do a manual installation following these steps:

1. Navigate to your addon folder by going to `{Wow Install Folder}\_classic_\Interface\AddOns`. By default, `{Wow Install Folder}` is in your Program Files.

2. Download all the code as a zip:

- In this page, click on the green `Code` button:

![Installation Code Button](/design//pictures/install_1.png)

- Then you click the `Download ZIP` option:

![Installation ZIP](/design/pictures/install_2.png)

3. Open the zip file. You will see a single folder called `RocketLootReserve-main`. Click and drag that to your wow addon folder located in step 1

4. You're done!
