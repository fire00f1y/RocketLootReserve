# Rocket Loot Reserve

This is a fork of the [LootReserve](https://github.com/Anonomit/LootReserve) addon for World of Warcraft. We are using
it as a base and adding additional functionality in that our guild specifically needs.

## Installation

There are currently no plans to distribute this via one of the popular methods such as Curse or WowUp. Instead, you
will need to download this whole thing as a zip and extract it to your `Interface/Addons` folder directly.

## New Features

We want to make a couple of additions:

1. Ability to have multiple people be host of the SR session
2. Be able to share data amongst several hosts
3. Track week-over-week reserves to add additional values to people's rolls so that if someone reserves the same item
   religiously they get rewarded with increased chance to win
4. Display updates to include the +modifier system wherever applicable
